Problem Statement

There are some concentration profiles present that are characteristic to various 
temperature ranges. And you need to identify the type for reaction profile obtained for distinct 
temperature ranges. However, the data being of high dimension, it is difficult to visualize the various 
subtypes. Perform principal component analysis to visualize every concentration signature in 2D plane. The attached dataset is the concentration profiles for different temperatures. Find the attached excel 
file having multivariate time series data.  
Perform the dimension reduction (from p to k, k=3), where p=number of time points, 
plot them to visualize if the different concentration profiles (time course) remain 
different in 3 planes.
